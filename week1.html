                <div class="text-section">
                    <p>My first week of On-the-Job Training at the NSTP Office was all about getting familiar with a new environment and slowly adjusting to the office atmosphere. I was warmly welcomed by the staff, who patiently walked me through the daily operations and explained the overall structure of how things work in the department. I spent time observing how documents flowed in and out of the office and how each staff member had their own role in keeping everything running smoothly. One of the first things I noticed was how organized and systematic the office was, which helped calm my nerves and allowed me to settle in more comfortably. I was assigned to simple but essential tasks like printing papers, sorting through supplies, and arranging documents that had been scattered around the workstations. These responsibilities, though basic at first glance, gave me a glimpse into the kind of attention to detail and care that administrative work requires. I also learned where various files were kept, how to navigate folders properly, and how to use the printing and copying machines efficiently. It felt nice being able to contribute, even in small ways, and I started gaining confidence with each task I completed. Every little instruction helped me better understand how I could be useful to the team. The environment felt encouraging, and I appreciated how the staff made sure I was comfortable while also making sure I was learning.</p>

                <div class="text-section">
                    <p>Aside from the technical side of the work, one of the things that stood out to me the most during my first few days was the emphasis on professionalism and ethics. Early on, I was taught about the importance of maintaining confidentiality, especially when dealing with student records or official school files. This was a big responsibility, and I appreciated how the staff explained it clearly and made sure I understood how serious it was. They also discussed how to conduct myself in the office, from proper communication to dressing appropriately and maintaining a respectful attitude at all times. Courtesy was not just encouraged it was expected, especially when dealing with students or other staff members. These lessons weren’t just about following rules, but about shaping how I approached my work and interactions in a respectful, mature way. I found this part of the training incredibly valuable because it showed me that technical skills alone aren’t enough character and attitude matter just as much. Even though I wasn’t directly handling major tasks yet, I felt that learning these values was preparing me for more responsibility in the coming weeks. It also made me reflect on how my behavior impacts the overall atmosphere of a workplace. I started becoming more mindful of how I carried myself, both in terms of how I did my work and how I interacted with the people around me. These early insights helped set the tone for my entire OJT experience.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="text-section">
                    <p>By the end of the week, I felt like I had already learned so much even though I had only been doing light tasks. It was clear that every small responsibility had a purpose, and the staff made sure I understood how my work contributed to the team’s overall goals. What started as simple document printing and filing slowly turned into opportunities to observe how the office communicated, planned, and responded to different needs. I appreciated that I wasn’t rushed or pressured I was allowed to learn at a steady pace, and I could always ask questions when I felt unsure about something. The support I received from the NSTP staff made me feel more confident in taking initiative, even if it was just volunteering to help sort new materials or asking if I could try using certain office tools. I also took note of things I wanted to improve on, such as my typing speed and my familiarity with office equipment. Everyday, I could already sense that this experience was going to help me grow, not only as a student but as a future professional. It gave me a glimpse into what real office work feels like and helped me transition from a classroom mindset to a workplace mindset. While there were moments when I felt unsure, those were balanced by moments of encouragement and learning. Looking back on my first week, I felt grateful to have had a supportive environment where I could slowly but steadily start my OJT journey.</p>
